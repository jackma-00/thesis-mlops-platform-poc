Monitoring is at the cornerstone of reliable ML systems able to consistently unlock the value of data and provide critical feedback for improvement.

The most widely used dimensions of monitoring in the ML industry are the following:
- data drift
- target drift 
- performance drift 

*Bear in mind to switch the MLProject entrypoint to run different monitoring python files.*
